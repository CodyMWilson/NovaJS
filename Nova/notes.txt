Give ship a position in the universe, and a velocity. Cartesian.

Make a function that goes from position in the universe to position on
the stage. For the player's ship, it always puts it in the center of
the stage (for now ;-). So this function has a reference to the
player's ship, and uses it to peer inside to get it's position in the
universe. Use vector subtraction to find the position on the stage of
any position in the universe. This function can return in addition to
an x and y of position on the stage, a boolean that says whether it's
on the stage or off it.
