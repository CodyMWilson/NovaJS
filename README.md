An experiment in making Nova run in the browser.
EV Nova is a game created by Ambrosia Software et al (http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/evn/)

Requirements: Node and npm.

Setup: 
Run `npm install`. Then, run the `start.sh` command from /Nova (which is just `node index.js`). Then, navigate your browser (works on chrome) to localhost:8000
